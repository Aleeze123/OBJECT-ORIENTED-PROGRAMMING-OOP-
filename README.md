OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP)
OBJECT-ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING(OOP) OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. 
It's a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code into objects that have both data (properties) and behavior (methods).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript can be understood through the four main pillars or principles of OOP.
These principles are:

Encapsulation
Abstraction
Inheritance
Polymorphism 


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript is a way of writing code where we organize our data (like variables) 
and functions (like actions we want to do with the data) into bundles called "objects". These objects can interact with each other, 
and each object can have its own unique set of data and functions. OOP helps make our code easier to manage and reuse.
