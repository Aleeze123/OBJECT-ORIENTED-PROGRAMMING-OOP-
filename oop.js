/*                                         Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

OOP in JavaScript stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
It's a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing code
into objects that have both data (properties) and behavior (methods).
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript can be understood through the four main pillars or principles of OOP.
 These principles are:

1) Encapsulation:

Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate
on the data into a single unit (class or object).
Implementation in JavaScript: In JavaScript, encapsulation can be achieved through closures and object literals.
Private variables and methods can be simulated using closures, while public methods can access and modify these
private variables.

2) Abstraction:

Definition: Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only
 the essential features or functionalities.
Implementation in JavaScript: Abstraction in JavaScript can be achieved by defining interfaces (public methods)
 that provide access to the objectâ€™s functionality while hiding its underlying implementation.
 
3) Inheritance:

Definition: Inheritance allows one object (subclass/derived class) to acquire the properties and behaviors of
 another object (superclass/base class). It promotes code reusability and supports hierarchical classification.
Implementation in JavaScript: JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, where objects can inherit properties and
methods from other objects. This is achieved by linking objects through prototypes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prototype inheritance in javascript is the linking of prototypes of a parent object to a child object to share
and utilize the properties of a parent class using a child class. Prototypes are hidden objects that are used
to share the properties and methods of a parent class with child classes.

4) Polymorphism:

Definition: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, but still behave like
their own class. It enables flexibility and dynamic behavior in OOP.
Implementation in JavaScript: Polymorphism in JavaScript can be achieved through method overriding.
 Subclasses can override methods of their superclass to provide specific implementations while still
 adhering to a common interface.
 
These pillars of OOP provide a structured approach to designing and implementing software systems in JavaScript,
promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. Understanding and applying these principles
effectively can lead to better-designed applications .
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript is a way of writing code where we organize
 our data (like variables) and functions (like actions we want to do with the data) into bundles called "objects".
These objects can interact with each other, and each object can have its own unique set of data and functions.
OOP helps make our code easier to manage and reuse.

// Base class Person implementing Encapsulation and Abstraction
var Person = /** @class */ (function () {
    function Person(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    Person.prototype.displayDetails = function () {
        console.log("Name: ".concat(this.name, ", Age: ").concat(this.age));

var Girl = /** @class */ (function (_super) {
    __extends(Girl, _super);
    function Girl(name, age, hobby) {
        var _this = _super.call(this, name, age) || this; // Inheritance
        _this.hobby = hobby; // Encapsulation
        return _this;
    }
    Girl.prototype.displayDetails = function () {
        _super.prototype.displayDetails.call(this); // Polymorphism
        console.log("Hobby: ".concat(this.hobby));

    return Girl;
}(Person));
// Usage
var person1 = new Person("John Doe", 30);
var girl1 = new Girl("Aleeze", 25, "Reading");
person1.displayDetails(); // Output: Name: John Doe, Age: 30
girl1.displayDetails(); // Output: Name: Aleeze, Age: 25
//         Hobby: Reading
